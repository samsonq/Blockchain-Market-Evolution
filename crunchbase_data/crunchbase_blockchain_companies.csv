Since the dawn of agriculture, human beings have continually sought higher efficiency and security in the production and trading of food. The modern age has seen the economics of agriculture and soft commodities repeatedly transformed by sudden technical innovations, a pattern which will continue to repeat itself. In the 1850’s advancements in refrigeration and food preservation dramatically lowered food prices and increased availability. In the 1940’s innovation came in the form of gasoline tractors replacing horse drawn plows. Today, blockchain technology is poised to play a major part in the agricultural revolution of our time. 
GrainChain’s patent pending solution utilizes blockchain technology to address numerous issues present within the soft commodities markets, such as fraud at all stages, large and small-scale corruption, payment delays, access to futures commodities market, and a cycle of debt that is difficult to escape. 
GrainChain changes this. 

GrainChain utilizes the well known properties of blockchains to address the systemic problems present in soft commodities markets, an industry in which the GrainChain team already has first hand experience in building software solutions. 
The GrainChain system greatly increases transparency and accountability within the agriculture business by eliminating disparate and wasteful paper trails, greatly eliminating the opportunity for fraud and dramatically reducing time and costs. It ensures the prompt and secure execution of contracts between farmers and buyers, by both automatically facilitating payment to the farmer and making available the corresponding financial instrument for trading on commodities markets while verifying it is backed by only real assets in the system. This shortens a process that can currently take weeks down to a nearly instantaneous one.

During the past 4 years, we’ve managed to discover and polish an outstanding formula to generate music content like no other… We have come up with a music collaboration model that even allows non-musicians to be part of music creation by writing lyrics on our platform and having well-known artists collaborate and create songs out of those lyrics through our record label, Weballooning… 

And I know that you’re probably wondering what exactly is Weballooning...

Weballooning is the name of our digital record label, which in other words means it is an asset generator! 

Weballooning consists of arranging live music sessions where we gather musicians and artists from different bands and have them write and record a song within 48 hours, using some of the lyrics that their fans have posted on our platform. In other words, we’re the first digital record label to produce and sell music written between artists and fans. And believe me when I say that the results are mind-blowing. The sound of the songs is an unprecedented thing. We currently have more than 250,000 monthly listeners on Spotify and YouTube, and over 9.2 million plays with just 12 launched songs, and without any budget for marketing, which takes me to the next and probably the most important thing about this presentation: Music Backed Securities…

We’ve already started collecting and managing music royalties out of our current songs catalog but we need liquidity to scale, That’s why after more than 2 decades of having such a financial instrument issued by David Bowie and financial innovator David Pullman, we want to retake the “Bowie Bonds” concept and turn it into the first Music Backed Securities market. 

According to Billboard Magazine, Bowie Bonds were ahead of their time however, thanks to the re-emergence of the music industry and the rise of the Blockchain technology, we want to create the first financial market and mutual fund that issues and sells Asset Backed Securities collateralized by pools of songs and/or song derivatives that can serve as a new investment vehicle to be traded in our own platform or even just used as a collectible!

We’ve worked and released songs with national and international famous Latin-American artists, and we’re looking to broaden our horizon by reaching out and inviting worldwide music celebrities to collaborate next.

We believe that true innovation comes not only from creating great products, but creating a new mindset… That’s why for the first time ever we’re making it possible for non-musicians to be part of music creation, for big artists to collaborate and engage with their fans in a new way, and for investors to be part of the next generation of Music Backed Securities with which they’ll be able to, not only diversify their portfolios and periodically earn yields over long periods of time, but to be part of the creation of amazing music between artists and fans.

Because we believe that, if a single mind has been able to create a masterpiece, imagine what we could create all together.","Financial Services, Internet Services, Media and Entertainment, Music and Audio",www.aballoon.com

The Elephant,"Blockchain, FinTech, Professional Services",THE FIRST TOKENIZED SECONDARY MARKET PLATFORM for Shares of pre-IPO Companies,Nov 2013,—,Active,—,—,"The Elephant Platform (formerly PrivatEquity.biz Platform) is a tokenized platform in the private secondary market.

It is a bridge between the secondary market investment world and the Blockchain space that allows cryptocurrency holders to diversify their portfolio by getting access to tokens linked to and backed by real assets, such as shares of pre-IPO companies (Target Companies). At the same time, The Elephant Platform enables private share owners and investors to unlock the value of these assets by creating and selling their equity tokens. The Platform enhances liquidity and transparency of assets, as well as minimizes transaction costs.

The Platform is already active, though not in the tokenized model, offering shares of popular tech companies which were listed on the Platform by their shareholders, mostly employees. The mentioned companies are all at the pre-IPO stage and meet the qualification criteria of the Platform. Performing a secondary transaction for purchase of shares is subject to reaching an agreed price and subject to further procedures that govern shares of a private company, such as right of first refusal, corporate approvals etc.

The Elephant Platform seeks to create a scenario that benefits all participants via the secondary transactions it facilitates; investors gain access to previously inaccessible shares of Target Companies while shareholders in these Target Companies gain access to liquidity prior to an exit or an IPO, especially “small” investors and “small” shareholders who lack the resources and/or ability of putting together a secondary market transaction on their own.",Financial Services,thelephant.io/

The driving force behind this company is the never-ending fight against mediocrity and ridiculously farcical attempts by other service providers to dub themselves as “businesses.”

KEY Difference is a journey, not a company. This journey is about helping businesses succeed at what they do best; success that is measured in terms of the people whose lives our clients’ services or products can touch and enhance. KEY Difference is a journey, not a company.

KEY Difference is a phenomenon, not an entity. Our purpose is to serve companies by doing what we do best – helping them get more visibility so they can provide their services and products to more people who need them. Our success comes from the success of others – yes, even our competitors. Competitors are not enemies; they are friends who are merely marching to the beat of a different drum. If we all get together on the same rhythm, we can create a powerful pulse that will be heard across the world. 

KEY Difference is a culture, not a corporation. The basic premise behind all our activities is to create an environment of commercial success and personal fulfillment. We make money because we need money to change the world. We are not idealists; we are realists with very real ideas for an idealistically real world! We are not out to create a parallel world that aligns with our objectives; we use our objectives to align the world to standards of excellence and prosperity that we feel are “normal” and “right.” We strive to bring a sense of responsibility to the world of commerce – something that is sadly and glaringly missing in today’s scenario. We create an environment where excellence is merely a starting point. We bring a fresh paradigm to work, where the best kind of work doesn’t feel like work at all! We don’t employ people; we exchange money for implemented ideas.","Content and Publishing, Media and Entertainment, Sales and Marketing",www.keydifferencemedia.com
Opporty Inc.,"B2B, Blockchain, Cryptocurrency",Opporty is a three-layered business relationships ecosystem,"May 1, 2014",$1M to $10M,Active,—,—,"Opporty is a blockchain-powered, three-layered business relationships ecosystem, consisting of a Proof-of-Expertise protocol, a conditional business scoring system, and a B2B/B2C marketplace. 

Opporty ensures transparency and security, standardizes procedures, and creates an environment of cooperation that instills trust between parties doing business. Aspiring to become a global business marketplace and an expertise validation provider on the Blockchain, Opporty offers a solution that establishes and grows trusted business relationships globally.

Opporty heavily relies on its Proof-of-Expertise protocol that, while collecting and analyzing transaction metadata, empowers Opporty’s scoring system to attach domain-relevant expertise to digital business identities and individually rank every vendor and service provider. This ecosystem allows for more secure domestic and international transactions, corporation and government procurement, and supply chain risk management.

With Ethereum’s Plasma Cash Protocol as its underlying technology, Opporty has developed a permission-based version of the Opporty ecosystem called Opporty Enterprise Solution (OES).

Plasma Cash protocol allows for the creation of child blockchains, which are governed by a parent blockchain. These child chains can have different consensus rules, functionality and underlying base tokens. Such extensions naturally fit with Proof-of-Expertise, with OPP as the underlying token used for manipulation, and allows for the development of private, blockchain-powered applications, such as Opporty Enterprise Solution.

Given the technologies utilized, Opporty Enterprise Solution can be implemented onto third-party platforms and applications. It can be used in enclosed corporate environments that need all data to be kept private and inaccessible to third parties, outside of the system.

Corporations can implement OES to enjoy safe and secure storage of transaction metadata, blockchain-based processing of transactions, privacy of selected transactions, and transaction analysis to assign scores for specific activities.

Specific use cases of Opporty Enterprise Solution include: production tracking, food safety and certification, cross-border payments and clearance, supply chain visibility, automatic dispute settlement, and asset transfer.","Financial Services, Payments, Software",opporty.com/

Who we are

Our firm’s disciplined approach to provide outstanding support, cutting-edge technology, and financial planning services to our clients enables us to continue focusing on serving our customers’ best interests through highly effective and customized solutions.

We pride ourselves on the concept of Total Asset Management. We are committed to learning your needs and desires, assessing safety and risk, and developing the appropriate strategy to achieve your goals.

To meet our clients’ long-term wealth management objectives, we implement a conviction based management approach within a streamlined management team and a deliberately narrow range of funds. Our fund managers are experts in their respective fields. Each morning, they exchange views and site visit reports in order to develop their investment strategy.

Our Principles

Three fundamental principles have underpinned our investment method since the creation of BTC Trading Inc. Our managers, analysts and advisors put them into practice on a daily basis, thereby contributing to the success and growth of BTC Trading Inc.

Conviction based – management approach

Conviction-based management on a human scale, rather than index-linked management determined by mathematical models, reducing crosstalk from market indices, our fund management favours maximum flexibility in investment decisions.  Our responsible and specialised asset managers, thrive on group discussion, whilst creating portfolios that are true to our convictions, unconstrained by sector and geographic limits, often with a long-term vision.

A narrow range

Since our launch, the company has remained faithful to the same principles: manage only a few funds, but do it well.  We strive to ensure that the range is concentrated on flagship products.

Each new fund is the result of our internal expertise combined with the identification of new investment opportunities for our clients. Compliance with this principle, style and adherence to this principle, is the cornerstone of our management style’s success.

Cross-fertilisation

Our management approach favours teamwork, idea sharing and cultural and geographic diversity. It is a real shared venture connecting 39 fund managers and analysts.

The management team boasts a wealth of expertise: equity markets, bonds and macro-economy. The daily exchange of viewpoints and knowledge is essential. Each manager benefits from the team’s combined input, which enhances their individual experience and convictions.

Galisto,"Blockchain, Business Intelligence, Data Integration, Education, Information Technology, Internet, Knowledge Management, Software",SaaS,2014,—,Active,—,—,"Knowledge management is THE growing challenge for quite each company!

The core IT-activities of a company and its people are quite the same: 
They just want to create, store, refind, maintain and share information and knowledge.

One of the biggest issues for companies today is to provide that goal over the large variety of applications and devices which are in use. 
A lot of effort is needed to synchronize data between systems and to find information in all these systems. 

Collaboration with external partners often results in additional time waste, because of the effort for the multiple administration of information in different data silos.

The Galisto-Platform solves these challenges. 
It interconnects existing applications and systems and improves this way the usability of the information. 
The result is a significant time-saving to find and organize data. 
External partners may be integrated in a private and secure way, e.g without exposing confidential information e.g. to email systems.

What's the difference to systems like Sharepoint or Confluence?

Galisto is able to adapt to the companies and users individual needs in a simple way. Galisto does not try to redefine the challenges until they fit to the system.

Galisto sets the focus to the context of the information. 
Users have to deal with changing context the whole daily business. 
Supporting them in managing context leads to improved quality of their work and significant time savings.

And yes: For most of the functions Galisto provides, there already other tools doing the same. 
The USP of Galisto is the combination and integration of these functions in one platform. 
Galisto allows to interconnect knowledge of different existing data-silos. 
Users can do their work most of the time with one single user inteface (UI). 
They have access to a lot of different data sources without the need to use all their different UIs.

In most cases there is no or only small need to customize for the initial steps using the Galisto-Platform. 
Galisto connects existing Data from existing sources and allows an improved usability. 
There is a very low initial risk, because no customisation of existing data or datasources is needed.

Galisto allows the long-lasting availability and usability of a companies relevant and possibly unstructured knowledge. 
Organisational changes have less impact to knowledge-loss 

For companies applying the Galisto-Platform, a lower TCO (total cost of ownership) is resulting, mainly causes by time-saving. 

For the owner, a very interesting margin on invested capital is resulting.

 We currently make translations of scientific papers, formatting of articles, journals issues and books according to specific requirements (e.g. LaTeX), assist in conversations with editorial boards, provide patenting services, arrange conferences and provide all possible technical and consulting assistance to those authors who do not have possibilities to submit their manuscripts directly because of lack of time, poor knowledge of foreign languages or any other reasons.

The platform is designed to solve the following problems:
- The academic world suffers from serious lack of funding
- Thereby lots of studies are not thoroughly elaborated
- Promising scientists are put under a tedious underpaid work with no reference to their achievements
- Scientists rarely check the reproducibility of results
- Reviewing does not work, the critic's opinion does not reflect the exact reality of the work done by the scientist
- Lots of studies, scientific publications and the work of the scientist require hefty fees
- People are very poorly informed about the achievements of science

Our headquarters is located in Krakow. We collaborate with universities, publishers, hosts of conferences, research centers, business incubators around the world.

For now the Big Time is being enlarged by introduction of the blockchain technologies in the services we provide and starting new directions so that the platform will further include:

Our blockchain web-site: big-time.io
Main site with a 7-year-old sustainable business model: wos-scopus.eu (Europe) and wos-scopus.com (CIS countries)
where you may see dozens of positive feedbacks from real clients. 

For the time being, Michael Levitt, a 2013 Nobel Laureate in Chemistry, joined our advisory board as a respectable person from the scientific community itself, where we are implementing the technology of blockchain in science and thereby expanding the current business by means of starting ICO.

Not very clear what kind of current problem the blockchain solves?
Let me explain - when sending materials of scientific papers for their consideration and possible publication in scientific journals etc., the intellectual property of the scientist can be borrowed and left unprotected from the theft.
In addition, our aggregator combines genius minds from different countries, which eventually can produce a brilliant discovery, but each one set a high value on the best practices on each side (e.g., when a scientist from Germany cooperates with a scientist from Japan). The findings are required to be shared under someone's consolidation.
That is - the first problem that decides blockchain - the transfer of intellectual property at a certain point in time and its validation and consolidation for each of the owners.
Similarly, we can talk about patenting of inventions and other materials. We are also engaged in this business.","Biotechnology, Education, Science and Engineering",wos-scopus.eu

Intalex offers a sophisticated trading platform that affords ease of use and simplicity for all users.

The fundamental value proposition of Intalex is to leverage the power of our secure, robust and regulated platform to create a new global market for recruitment agencies and employers to trade directly with each other, thereby allowing them to benefit from the global demand and supply imbalance rather than struggle with it, as is currently the case.
The exchange connects recruitment professionals and employers from around the world on a single trading access point, creating an exclusive and enclosed market for Intalex members to trade their candidates and jobs directly.
We believe our platform will change the face of how companies recruit talent from both a cost and time perspective.
Intalex shrinks the globe, country and individual city markets and enables the smallest agency to compete with the largest agent, for mutual benefit and transaction success. Conversely, the Intalex platform also helps large, global employers with niche aggregated talent supply chain of global and specialist recruiters. Not only will the employer have access to the world’s best talent, they will also benefit from paying less for that talent through our unique reverse auction facility. For employers, Intalex seeks to disrupt the current cost model of recruitment by inverting it, putting the pricing control back into their hands.
Intalex is headquartered in Dublin, Ireland, which is regarded as Europe’s technology hub, with a further sales and marketing office in San Francisco. 

Given Ireland’s proximity to both Europe and the USA, we believe we are ideally positioned to serve these markets. Intalex was founded by two successful technology and recruitment entrepreneurs, Ray Nolan and Jason Kennedy, who have an impressive track record of creating technology solutions which drive cost and other significant efficiencies in large global markets.","Administrative Services, Information Technology, Internet Services",www.intalex.com/

We build member-owned and governed decentralised network platforms for the peer-to-peer exchange of tokenised value between network members. Our ethos and architecture is grounded in protocol, peer-to-peer architecture, removing friction and market inefficiencies, strong security guarantees and interoperable exchange across platforms to build a peer-to-peer ecosystem for market infrastructure. Our focus is capital markets; we work with firms that have the ambition to reinvent the industry's business models.

Our technology is p2p network platforms and protocol first - protocol suite, software that implements those protocols and provides client software and infrastructure for p2p networks. Its based on Ethereum and we call it Autonity - the protocol, the Geth-based client.

We use our technology to build p2p networks and dFMI.

P2p networks are private, member-owned and governed networks that enable peer-to-peer transfer of financial value and automation of contractual and fiduciary operations without reliance on trusted third-parties. Such decentralised networks can interact with one another, creating a wider ecosystem of value and leveraging the network effect, and they can form part of a dFMI.

dFMI is a new concept, one that builds on the security and resilience guarantees of distributed ledger and systems engineering to provide a platform for tokenising value and transferring its ownership between participants on that or, by cross-platform exchange, on other platforms.

We believe that our technology will drive adoption of a next-generation dFMI where intermediaries are removed, incentive structures encourage self-regulation, and risks are mitigated and reduced to the maximum. dFMI doesn't just provide a cryptographically secure environment for market participants to transact, it provides a peer-to-peer model that removes financial intermediaries and engenders a wider ecosystem for value transfer across platforms and pre- post-trade processes. dFMI works to mitigate concentration and liquidity risk, reduce settlement cycles to real-time, remove friction, and lower the transaction cost of economic exchange.

This type of technology is especially critical in markets where a one-minute supply chain inefficiency can lead to massive revenue increases.

Procurean also enables businesses to digitalize their processes before the actual inquiry so that they can have an SSOT (single source of truth) for their administration, planning and management purposes – demand management, item management and vendor management. 

Doing so Procurean provides easy access to digitalization and networks to SMEs who otherwise wouldn't have access to best-in-class business solutions and international opportunities (business partners). Being accessible and easy-to-use, a cloud-based web application could be utilized by businesses just minutes after registering. Businesses can also choose to integrate their existing ERP systems with Procurean in full or in part. 

At the end of each business transaction on the platform as a consequence of inquiries, businesses exchange a multi-dimensional evaluation which is stored (along with the financial indicators collected from smart data providers) on a public blockchain, to ensure immutability and transparency. This ‘Trust rank’ serves as an intermediary between companies. It’s an indicator of Transparency & Reliability and an incentive for companies to act fair and reliably toward their business partners, both known and unknown.

The ease with which monetary value can now easily flow into Myanmar opens up many new opportunities for the country and its people.

Our long-term goal is to apply new technologies to facilitate large-scale market-driven societal improvement across Southeast Asia, which has many big problems that still need to be solved (excluding Singapore, which has most of the privileged 1% of Southeast Asia who don't need help). We are starting with Myanmar, as I have family connections via my parents who were citizens, and it has a high concentration of serious humanitarian problems, many of which I have witnessed first-hand there.

SKYBIT's initial services are:
Payment Processor:
SKYBIT will take cryptocurrency payment and credit the merchant or charity organization with Myanmar Kyat currency. Therefore:
1. Any Myanmar person or business can now offer their goods and services to the entire world on the internet with the expectation of receiving money for them through SKYBIT;
2. Donations worth even a small amount can now easily come into Myanmar.
These were previously impossible or difficult.

Ad Pages:
Users who do not have their own web site can advertise or campaign to raise funds on SKYBIT Ad Pages. This can expand our market and therefore user base to a much greater portion of the Myanmar population.

Exchange:
Users can swap cryptoassets and local currency on our trading platform.


SKYBIT as a company aims to apply cutting-edge technologies to Myanmar in order to make a significantly positive difference to the country and the lives of its people.

We embrace innovation, open-mindedness, lateral thinking and creative ideas that can solve real problems and immensely improve efficiency and productivity in both business and everyday living. We are not afraid to challenge or discard antiquated thinking and beliefs that restrain progress, much of which still persists in Myanmar. We will disrupt the status quo in order to improve the country, its economy, and the lives of all Myanmar people who for so long have been denied a better future until recently.

We are building the groundwork for the upcoming paradigm shift of individual empowerment via freely-flowing global value exchange. Together, we have the potential to revolutionize entire industries and even create new ones in Myanmar. This will help to economically strengthen the country and in turn raise the standards of living of Myanmar society at all levels. The possibilities of applying innovative technologies to Myanmar in particular are profound, if given enough thought as we have.

Those who choose to remain with outdated systems and practices and refuse to adapt or explore can step aside to make way for the dawning of an exciting new era of mass social development in Myanmar that is driven by rapid technological advancement and leapfrogging. Join us in our quest to propel Myanmar forward and upward. The sky is the limit.","Community and Lifestyle, Financial Services, Lending and Investments, Payments, Software",SKYBIT.ASIA

Trusted In Trading,"Blockchain, Cryptocurrency, Digital Media, Financial Services, FinTech, Social Media","TrustedIn Trading is a Social platfrom for Startups, Entreprenuers, Vc's, Accelerators and Companies....","Aug 1, 2015",Less than $1M,Active,—,—,"For the past three years, the Trusted In Trading team has been developing a concept to reduce fraud and boost growth within the financial services and business sectors. To do this, we have modeled multiple use cases of blockchain technology and incorporated bio-metrics to package web and mobile applications. 

 Our primary concept is based on the development of a social validation platform on which both corporate and individual users are validated through a complete, in depth, due diligence process. 

This verifies not only the identity, licensing and regulatory status of corporations and professionals but also the identities and accreditation of individuals. The aim of this process is to reduce corporate, professional and individual identity theft and associated fraud within the financial and business sectors. This will be achievable globally in a decentralized system using blockchain technology. 

Fraud is on the rise every year in various market sectors and sub-sectors globally, where the rates of fraudulent activities tied to corporate or personal identity theft have risen to astronomical levels. This is in part due to the availability of information on social media platforms and other information portals. 

In Proofpoints 2014 research, it was found that Fortune 100 companies are popular targets for fraud. 

Approximately 40% of Facebook accounts and 20% of Twitter accounts claiming to represent a Fortune 100 brand are unauthorized. 
This has permeated all sub sectors, from the asset management industry to newer sectors such as cryptocurrencies.  Currently, social media platforms are inadequate in providing account validation that requires an in-depth due diligence process to inhibit fraud and enhance legitimate business.  

According to the 2016 Annual Fraud Indicator Report fraudulent activity costs were estimated to amount to £193 billion in the UK alone. 

At Trusted In Trading, we strongly believe that we can make a significant impact on how individuals and companies are affected through the development of our feature rich social validation platform with crypto-currency based escrow capabilities. 

Each company that chooses to validate their details and become part of the chain will reduce the risk of identity misuse. Moreover, they can use their verified accounts as  primary marketing channels whilst adhering to regulatory parameters established by national regulatory bodies.  
 
Trusted’s unique selling proposition (USP) is that up to date a multi-function social validation platform which is beneficial to all members of the financial and business sectors does not exist. The current social platforms are too generalized or, in some cases, too niche. 

A platform that provides features and tools for all members of the sector, from small business owners to multi-billion dollar hedge funds, will retain usage levels and appeal to a large cross section of the sectors. Not only this, but validation and escrow will improve business for those concerned.

Phases 1,2,3 and 4 will be the build and launch of the startup ecosystem which will encompass, crypto, social, asset managers and entrepreneurial ecosystems in conjunction wit7h a defined road to capital.","Financial Services, Internet Services, Media and Entertainment, Payments, Software",trustedintrading.com/

Magic Cube will initially focus on the gaming industry, due to our already established presence in the space. Magic Cube has seen these pain points first hand, through our own publishing and distribution business. We have 23 games in house and have 10 million users in aggregate.

Currently, game developers have no viable alternatives to the monopolistic publishing and distribution models, where game publishers/distributors extract 90% of the future income of a game while providing little value to the game itself. Magic Cube allows for game developers to connect with early adopters through tokens launched in IGOs. IGOs, similar to ICOs (but where tokens have real utility value as opposed to mostly speculative value), will provide game developers with early adopters that will be financially rewarded for playing their games. Tokens have proven to attract people to adopting new software because it gives people skin in the game. Currently, it is difficult to convince people to play a new game, because no one else is playing it, and most games rely on network effects due to their social elements. Our model takes no future profit or revenue from the developers, and instead returns all of the financial rewards to developers and early players, instead of the monopolistic publishers.",Gaming,www.magiccube.io/

Flux originated in and is most active in Australia, but it is also active internationally, with groups existing in the United States and Brazil. IBDD is similar to liquid democracy, though there are differences. In IBDD, voters would still have the right to vote directly on every issue or delegate their vote to someone else, but unlike in liquid democracy, voters can choose to forego votes on one issue to use on another issue. This creates opportunity cost between issues and allows voters to specialise their votes on the issues that are more important to them. This specialisation of votes allows citizens to participate effectively in issue-based direct democracy without having to focus on every issue as they would in regular direct democracy. Software to implement IBDD is being developed by SecureVote, a startup company set up by Nathan Spataro and Max Kaye to bring Blockchain-based voting to Governments, Businesses and Token Ecosystems.","Government and Military, Information Technology, Software",voteflux.org/

Gramarye Media is the cross-media entertainment studio of the future, the first on the east coast — discovering, incubating, vetting, producing, and distributing original content, including books, films, games, AR and VR, merchandise, and more. We’re disrupting the Hollywood studio model.

With budgets soaring, original content is risky because it lacks brand awareness. Meanwhile, analysts and executives agree: the cycle of sequels and remakes is presenting increasing danger to industry profitability. In addition, there is tremendous waste built into the Hollywood system. 

Executives and analysts agree: Hollywood spends at least twice what it should making films.

Gramarye has recognized that these issues provide an opportunity for disruption. Our process is based on three core concepts:

1.	Reduce Risk — Discover original content with a built-in, proven audience
2.	Produce Content at a Significantly Lower Cost for multiple cross-media channels in concert to open new opportunities for revenue generation 
3.	Own access to Distribution Channels

All three pillars will generate revenue.


Blockchain Technology

Gramarye makes disruptive use of blockchain technology in two ways: 

•	First, Gramarye’s SEC-Compliant ICO raise makes us the first major studio funded by a cryptocurrency offer. It’s not just a Gramarye raise — we’re investing in a complete ecosystem of partner companies, each of which expand our capabilities and return dividends to token holders.

Second, Gramarye uses blockchain utility tokens (which cannot be purchased) to provide meaningful rewards and incentives to fan evangelists who spark the viral spread of brand awareness, and to stream content directly to consumers hungry for the core, generational stories that unite us all.","Content and Publishing, Gaming, Media and Entertainment, Video",gramaryemedia.com

Imagine the ability to replace every organisation with its decentralized counterpart —one that is governed through a decentralized governance structure, and in which users are also shareholders.

 Backfeed develops the foundational tools that work on top of blockchain technology in order to empower Decentralized Collaborations. It provides the protocols that make it possible for any disparate group of individuals to easily deploy decentralized applications based on spontaneous, large-scale and free collaboration. Backfeed protocols enable people to coordinate themselves through a decentralized governance model that distributes token rewards and reputation to all collaborators, based on the perceived value of their contributions. The protocols are designed to encourage the internal alignment of individuals within a given community, while also promoting diversity at the margins.

 Following the advent of Bitcoin, blockchain technologies have introduced many new opportunities for decentralized groups of people to coordinate themselves without the need for any third party to guide, control or mediate their actions. With blockchain technology, people can freely collaborate and transact on a peer-to-peer basis, they can deploy decentralized applications and services that benefit the entire community, as opposed to a small group of s

At Modex, we are able to innovate thanks to our incredible team of experts and we offer services for the entire blockchain technology ecosystem: Marketplace for Smart Contracts, community tools for developers and Blockchain Database (BCDB) for enterprise.   

About Modex | 
Modex was set up in 2017 to accelerate the global adoption of blockchain technology, by bridging the gap between businesses building blockchain projects and developers of smart contracts. The platform supports developers in the writing and deployment of smart contracts and offers a dynamic Decentralised Application (DApp) store to enable them to monetize and promote their work. Through Modex, developers can sell their smart contracts to thousands of businesses worldwide. A smart contract is a self-executing contract, with no trusted intermediary needed, as the terms between buyer and seller are written into lines of code. Blockchain is the open-source technology on which smart contracts are stored.
In 2019 Modex launches Modex BCDB, a new take on blockchain technology which removes the need to invest resources in blockchain training and facilitates fast adoption of the technology in businesses. The solution proposed by Modex is a middleware which fuses a blockchain with a database to create a structure which is easy to use and understand by developers with no prior knowledge in blockchain development. As a result, any developer who knows to work with a database system can operate with our solution, without needing to change their programming style or learn blockchain. Through our blockchain component, Modex BCDB is able to transform with minimal changes any type of database into a decentralized database which holds the same valuable characteristics inherent to blockchain technology: transparency, increased security, data immutability, and integrity.","Data and Analytics, Information Technology, Internet Services, Software",www.modex.tech

Climate change and environmental degradation are the largest existential threats to humanity in the 21st century, and also the largest economic opportunity of our time. These problems are fundamentally issues of economic coordination.

Regen Network, a Techstars-backed company, is a digital platform powered by Cosmos SDK that allows farmers, brands, and institutions to make auditable ecological agreements so that we can rapidly accelerate the adoption of regenerative agriculture and reverse global climate change.

Regen Network is comprised of two important parts.
We are building a Proof-of-Stake blockchain focused on ecological data, assets, and agreements using the Tendermint Consensus Engine and the Cosmos SDK. Join us to help secure what we believe will be the most important distributed ledger on Earth — the ledger of ecological health and agreements.

In addition to creating the underlying infrastructure necessary for ecological accounting, we’re also building real-world applications.

Investing in Regen Network
Now is the time to take bold action to reverse the degradation of this planet. This technology offers us an incredible opportunity to do just that. We are currently in a private pre-sale for our native staking token or offering convertible notes for equity if that is what you prefer. We will personally guide you through the investment process to make it as easy, private, and secure as possible.

Token Mechanics
Regen Ledger is secured through our staking token, the Regen token (XRN). XRN follows the Cosmos Proof-of-Stake consensus and token economics. By purchasing and staking XRN, you help secure this essential infrastructure and the public good it generates, plus staked tokens receive network fees and block rewards as compensation for this important work. For more detailed information please see our economics paper.

Regen Network Development, Inc. is building a contracting platform utilizing Regen Ledger to make easy and accessible ecological contracts between institutions and land managers, who may not have the capacity to interact directly with the blockchain. At the center of these agreements are scientifically-robust ecological protocols that verify a change in practice or outcomes on the ground.

The Market
A conservative estimate of the size of the Ecosystem Service Market came in at $36 billion in 2017. We expect this to grow to $1 trillion over the next decade as climate change accelerates and businesses and governments react to the economic disruption by beginning to value currently-externalized costs. We intend to capture a significant portion of this market.

  Based on its record and experienced team, Paymium is launching a new crypto-exchange: Blockchain.io. This platform will be fully dedicated to crypto-trading while Paymium will remain the privileged hub for fiat currencies. Paymium customers (currently at 170,000 + accounts) will automatically have a blockchain.io account and will obtain incentives for their loyalty.

 Our new platform will offer: 
- For users: centralized orderbooks (maximum liquidity) and decentralized settlement (even more security), advanced trading orders with Maker & Taker fees at 0.1% with additional discounts, market-making and peer-to-peer lending
- For entrepreneurs & institutions: ICO planning & execution services (thanks to an extensive network of bankers, lawyers, marketers, technologists, etc) up to the Blockchain.io exchange listing and guaranteed liquidity for BCIO tokens.

What sets us apart is a concentrated effort in Europe, where the crypto market is largely still in its infancy and which as of today lacks a transparent and regulated crypto-exchange with a proprietary token enabling institutions to launch their ICOs. Our proprietary token will allow us to offer incentives to bootstrap the liquidity of the trading platform.

It was founded in March 2017 in Maastricht, Netherlands. Through its cryptocurrency (DCN) and a set of incentivized software tools, the Foundation has managed to create a new dental ecosystem which favours all industry stakeholders: patients, dentists, manufacturers, suppliers, labs, insurance companies. The core purpose of the Foundation is to improve long-term health, reduce costs and pain, and continuously support the growth in the value of DCN.

Dentacoin owes its existence to the joint efforts of a group of like-minded dentistry and digital transformation experts eager to reshape the dental industry by adopting integrated, Blockchain-based technologies. The Foundation is backed by a vast community of progressive dentists committed to moving the focus from acute treatment to sustainable prevention in the interest of all people.

Dentacoin is the one and only cryptocurrency in the world that connects all participants in the global dental industry. In contrast to the inflation-prone world currencies, it holds the potential to make people richer rather than poorer. In its essence, Dеntacoin has a strong social aspect - it empowers people to receive affordable and sustainable dental care and to earn additional income for their active usage of Dentacoin Apps.

The Blockchain-based software tools developed by the Dentacoin Foundation are a means of distributing DCN cryptocurrency to the key end users (i.e. patients, dentists, manufacturers). In return for writing reviews about their dentist (Trusted Reviews Platform), taking dental surveys (DentaVox), and maintaining excellent oral hygiene (Dentacare Mobile dApp), they receive different amounts of DCN.

Thus, people within Dentacoin Ecosystem are encouraged to contribute to the improvement of dental care both on a personal and global level.

The next milestone on Dentacoin’s roadmap is the development of another two Blockchain-based applications - a revolutionary insurance-like model called Dentacoin Assurance, with its testnet already released and a secure, patient-managed Health Database.",Health Care,dentacoin.com/

Katalyo is a SaaS, zero-code (aka no-code) digital transformation platform

<​The mission/>
Katalyo is on a mission to empower people and provide them with the tools to build enterprise grade applications, even if they do not have the necessary coding skills.

<​The problem/>
There is saying that software developers are people with a magical skill of turning coffee into code. The demand for development of new applications is huge and there's either not enough coffee or developers in the world to bring all innovative applications to life. Katalyo has the solution in the form of the next generation low-code platform powered by the EOS blockchain.

<​What is different about Katalyo?/>
Katalyo is built in a way to mimic real life and deliver automation where the work is being done. In our daily lives we use various resources to achieve desired results. For that reason the main building block of Katalyo system is a resource. The system provides the tools to create and manage different types of resources like datasets, files or notifications for example. There is however a special type of a resource and that is work i.e. a task which has the ability to transform other resources and enable creation of workflows.

<​Why blockchain?/>
Katalyo is using a blockchain to introduce a token that is used to operate a rewarding system and enable and drive a marketplace where people can build various features and services on the platform and be rewarded in the form of Katalyo token.
Blockchain is also used to enable data immutability. This essentially means that data managed in the system can be tracked and managed on the blockchain for cases where data immutality feature is required which will enables a new level of both transparency and security of the data.","Apps, Software",www.katalyo.com

MIMIR Blockchain Solutions,"Blockchain, Information Technology, Software","We are the world’s first Decentralized Blockchain Service Provider (DBSP) bringing blockchain to those ""off-chain""",2017,—,Active,—,—,"MIMIR Blockchain Solutions, based in Atlanta, Georgia, is the world’s first Decentralized Blockchain Service Provider (DBSP), a new industry category that takes Blockchain as a Service (BaaS) beyond the cloud. Our flagship product, the MIMIR Blockchain to Internet (B2i) Bridge, brings blockchain to the “off-chained” by allowing direct access to the Decentralized Application ecosystem from any web connected device without the need for third-party trust; with limited or, in some cases, no pre-installed software necessary.

By leveraging existing nodes, the MIMIR Bridge can help B2B and B2C clients improve economics and smooth capacity issues. This innovative approach will also address current issues with blockchain (namely security, scalability, and accessibility).

The MIMIR B2i Token, the value mechanism behind the MIMIR B2i Bridge solution, will go beyond the cloud and traditional Blockchain as a Service (Baas) offerings. Our token is truly the first of its kind. In exchange for cryptocurrency, users will be given a small amount of MIMIR B2i tokens that will act as its own piece of infrastructure. Thus our B2I tokens, which can be used to actively participate on the network, become a steady source of revenue for holders.
	
While there is potential for penetration of the business to consumer (B2C) market, MIMIR sees business to business (B2B) as a larger market for growth (Frost & Sullivan, estimates best B2B e-commerce is set to reach $6.7 trillion by 2020). MIMIR is actively pursuing case study partners with Dapp developers and web API’S. These markets are in need of infrastructure solutions to satisfy the demand for nodes, which presently out-paces supply by an internal estimates of 48,248%. 

We believe our B2i technology can be seen in many areas of modern business, including but not limited to:

Identity Protection 
Car sharing 
Augmented Reality 
Business Preservation/Expansion
Asset Tracking/Supply Chain (Natural Disaster Relief/Humanitarian Efforts)
Secure Fund Transfer

MIMIR will have a live alpha test beginning early January 2018. Our Token sale will launch in Q1 of 2018. It is our expectation to have multiple case study partners by mid-2018, and an active beta version of the MIMIR B2i product ready for commercialization in late 2018.","Information Technology, Software",www.mimirblockchain.solutions

HCR has built its own Blockchain-enabled platform that allows music artists to retain ownership of their copyright assets, raise capital through ICOs to fuel their careers, and to build and engage a large fan base through a network effect. It is HCRs'​ vision to make the music industry fair and transparent, through better deals for both artist and their ‘fanvestors’.

For far too long, the music business has predominantly benefitted the ‘big’ record companies, leaving many music artists disillusioned as profits gained from their hard and talented work are bled dry.

The recent phenomenal changes within the respective worlds’ of music, technology and crowdsales have paved the way for a significantly better deal for artists, and fanvestors - everyday people who currently follow and support an artist, and want to do so in a more intimate and connected way. 

The changes, such as the digitisation of music, Blockchain technology and crowdsales are what HCR have absorbed in order to create a better ecosystem for artists and fanvestors. 

HCR allows artists with huge potential to retain ownership of their copyright assets and enjoy higher profits than are possible through the ‘traditional’ channels. 

HCR provides each artist with a Record Deal, and through its Blockchain platform enables the artist to raise the capital required to fuel their career via an ICO - and to build a large fan base through a network effect. Not only does this speed up the fundraising process, HCR empowers artists to do what they love doing most - producing and sharing their work with the world, in the quickest time possible.

Coin holders will have special privileges and access to the artist, their performances and merchandise. 

By harmonising the partnership of artists and investors and in democratising the industry, HCR offers a refreshingly different approach in bringing artists’ music to the masses.","Financial Services, Media and Entertainment, Music and Audio",www.huntercorprecords.com/

Rental of real estate in Switzerland has been an extremely lucrative investment with up to 8% return per annum for a very long time without interruption. Unfortunately, the minimum investment amounts required to buy a property are very high, as, for example, 3-room apartments in a city already cost over one million Swiss francs. This is where the Cryptectum comes in and, with the help of blockchain technology, allows small investors to profit from the rental of real estate. 

Via crowdfunding  Cryptectum collects funds, acquires a property and rents them out. Blockchain technology in turn helps to distribute rental income to investors in the simplest and most cost-effective way. In addition, the Cryptectum maintains the acquired property, which is a big plus for the investor, since he does not have to worry about it. 

However, an investor would also like to have a say in what property the Cryptectum acquires or whether the capital of the Cryptectum should be increased. The Cryptectum has integrated so-called proposals into the Smart Contract. The investor thus has the opportunity to vote on the acquisition of real estate or increase in liquidity. 

With Cryptectum, investors get the opportunity to benefit from the Swiss real estate market for as little as $ 1 investment. Investing in Cryptectum is a solid investment with a relatively high return and low risk.","Financial Services, Payments, Real Estate, Software",cryptectum.com/en/

Qooiver: Social Network Based on Interests,"Adventure Travel, Beauty, Blockchain, Blogging Platforms, Content, Content Creators, Cryptocurrency, News, Social News, Travel",Mobile App,2017,—,Active,—,—,"A social network based on relevance, where users interact on common interests, through a minimalist approach. Users are encouraged to create true communities inside the network, based on common interests. In these communities, they can grow together and further develop their passions with the help of relevant and nourishing content. Only by helping others develop you can truly evolve.

★ Use Qooiver to:

- Share photos and videos relevant to your interests that grab the attention of your peers
- Post as many pictures as you like to drive the interaction and develop a community around your common interests
- Use the chat to discuss, exchange ideas and information with like-minded people 
- Gain notoriety and followers by posting the most interesting content for your interests
- Follow top posters to get the best content for the things you love

★ How does Qooiver work?

Qooiver has two important components that help us create relevance: the “/” tag and the ”#” tag. All content is categorized by those two tags.

The “/” tag represents your passion and provides you with the possibility to create true communities around that passion. By having people with common interests collaborate we offer the possibility for them to develop in an enjoyable manner.

The “#” tag is meant to bring more relevance to your passion by narrowing down, pinpointing to the precise aspects of that category that you enjoy or you’re more interested in.

Qooiver drops the classic “friends relation” approach in favor of a less restrictive one. You’re free to follow whomever you consider to be a role model of your community.

By offering users relevant content and reliving them from classic social relationship constraints we allow them to truly express and develop. Users can join or create their own communities right from the start enjoying the desired content right away.

The “/” and “#” also allows us to provide a powerful search and filtering tool for the user to find relevant content or help them expand and find new passions.

Most current social network users are being driven away by the noise and repetitive content out there. To solve these problems most social networks are now trying to break this paradigm and strive towards relevance. We’re also trying to achieve this through Qooiver.

★ Join our growing community and help us change the world!

We connect Broadcasters, Distributors, Creators and Brands, enabling them to transact faster and at a lower cost while maintaining a trusted, single version of truth of the metadata and contractual rights they own, on the blockchain. Film & TV fans are also recruited and rewarded in our ecosystem, to help in the curation of metadata that is essential to support the industry.

With endorsements from senior management of major players in the industry including Disney, BBC Worldwide, ElevenSports and many more, Vuulr will lead the way for the film & TV content supply chain and retail. Disney, Fox, Amazon, HBO, Facebook, Apple, your local broadcaster and others are all locked in a fierce battle for your attention - and the revenue it generates. The one thing they all agree on is that Content is King.  Globally, this industry spends US$240 billion p.a. on buying content, growing at 10% per year. Yet, they still do business the old way. Acquiring content takes 4-5 months and involves huge amounts of manual effort. 35-40% of that value is lost to the friction of the transaction today.  The US$62 billion Sponsorship industry is in a similar state. Deals between buyers and sellers take months to conclude, with little selection science and long drawn-out offline negotiations. This inefficiency presents an exciting opportunity for VUULR to develop a Blockchain-based solution to reinvent how the industry operates. Vuulr’s Platform uses a two-pronged approach to create the new broadcast content economy:  

The VUULR MARKETPLACE --- will bring content owners, buyers and sponsors (brands) together digitally. It will enable content rights to be transacted globally, accelerating a process that takes months to complete offline today, into one that can be completed online in less than a day.  

The VUULR SUPPLY CHAIN --- built on the Ethereum Blockchain, will provide a trustable protocol, a distributed data layer, and a suite of dApps for managing and securing the industry’s key data as a single shared ledger. The Vuulr Supply Chain is an implementation of the industry-accepted MovieLabs Digital Distribution Framework (MDDF).  In addition to transforming the way the industry works today, Vuulr’s Blockchain-based approach will unlock new opportunities for the industry, e.g. new revenue sharing models enabled by a single, shared, and trusted view of what the audience is watching.

The VUULR REWARDS PROGRAM --- engages film and TV fans to enable them to monetise their passion for entertainment content. Fans can earn vuu tokens when they help with the translation and creation of the metadata essential to support the industry, in the delivery of the content to consumers.  Today, content is global. Vuulr will establish a global network of offices in key media capitals including Los Angeles, London, Mumbai, and Beijing, to establish Vuulr as a global platform connecting Hollywood, Bollywood and China to broadcasters and audiences globally.",Media and Entertainment,www.vuulr.com/

Blockpit GmbH,"Accounting, Blockchain, Cryptocurrency, FinTech, Personal Finance, Software","Blockpit has developed a cross-platform monitoring solution that is intended for companies, institutions and crypto currency traders.","Sep 28, 2017",—,Active,—,—,"Blockpit has developed a cross-platform monitoring solution that is intended for both companies and private crypto currency traders. This enables a clear calculation of the taxable crypto income and an acceptance of the tax return by tax consultants.

Crypto traders are often unaware of taxes on profits. Regular trading makes it difficult to keep track of the individual trades. This is mainly because every single transaction, including the exchange within crypto currencies, must be valued as a taxable event. If the tax office requests a declaration or proof, it will be difficult to provide this afterwards.
 
This is where Blockpit's software solution can help. The monitoring platform automatically records all sources of income and creates a clear log. Every single transaction is imported and guarantees a daily documentation of all trades.
In addition, the user receives an overview of the development of his portfolio and information on taxable profits and speculation periods.

Alarms for events such as value changes can be set in the system. The ""Tax tips"" option provides suggestions for tax optimization and information on regulatory changes in the crypto area.

Blockpit has built up a worldwide network of licensed tax advisors who can check and approve the documentation on request. This eliminates the risk of supplying false data to the tax office and therefore of being prosecuted for the crypto dealer.","Financial Services, Payments, Professional Services, Software",blockpit.io

Ensuring compliance often means considerable delay, with significant costs for service providers and deep frustration for genuine would-be customers. The issue is especially challenging for global firms that have to meet diverse compliance regulations in the various jurisdictions they operate in, where, in extreme cases, it can delay verification by up to 30 to 50 days. As a result, genuine clients experience frustration in securing the services they desire.

All too often KYC & AML requirements also serve to reinforce social exclusion of citizens and hinder integration efforts by reducing, or effectively even blocking, access to basic services such as the ownership of a bank account. It is calculated that up to 165 million people in Europe, including 40 million within the EU, still lack access to formal financial services, while the high cost of verification of Personally Identifiable Information (PII) for new migrants is prohibitive.

Many people are unable to receive benefits from the government digitally, including social security, basic health care, and even education. Lack of identification is particularly a hindrance to legal migration to other countries, and to receive remittances internationally through formal channels.

KnowMeNow is committed to addressing these problems, harnessing the power of the blockchain to deliver more efficient, more secure and more reliable ways of verifying and sharing data.

Our solution has the ability to greatly reduce current delays, costs, and duplication of effort, that may be caused by clients having to repeatedly produce information for verification purposes, every time a user attempts to secure services with new providers across many different sectors.","Financial Services, Information Technology, Payments, Privacy and Security, Software",www.knowmenow.com/

Every day thousands of containers are shipped all across the globe. The time required is disproportionate to the actual work that is required to process these shipments. Numerous phone calls, emails and even faxes are required in order to process one shipment. This requires a lot of time and labor and costs a lot of money. Trying to track shipments is nearly impossible. The frustration level for both the shipper and the vendors is always at an all time high.

Transship's platform is B2B and IoT. The User (shipper) simply has to upload required information such as what they are shipping, when, where, consignee as well as required documentation. On the back end, Transship will communicate with all the vendors via EDI/API and blockchain technology. This will not only speed up the processing of every shipment, but will also make it more efficient and require less labor. End result is a cost savings for the vendors and the shippers. 

Each shipment processed through Transship will have a tracking device provided by Sensor Transport. This will allow every User to know exactly where their shipment is, real time updates and real time temperature readings. Transship also has an agreement with TradeLens to use their API and blockchain technology on our site. 

Transship will replace all outdated freight forwarders with modern day technology that is so sorely lacking in the logistics industry. Transship will serve the global marketplace with the ability to process shipments from anywhere around the world.

Transship will do to international shipments of perishable goods what Fed Ex and UPS did to parcel shipments; more efficient, more accessible and more cost effective.

Credentialing involves not only collecting up to 30 (required by law) existing identity and work history documents but also the creation of new information: the knowledge that a 3rd party credentialler or medical staffer did additional work to double check the information. Right now, verifications must be re-done each time a worker switches jobs, and no value is created from previous verifications. For verifications, we leverage the public, Ethereum blockchain to build trust, transparency, and the ability to audit.

connect and transact. Furthermore, We create VQ Ecosystem of Marketplaces that concentrates on

We design and build VQ Marketplace Ecosystem, a decentralized open source marketplace ecosystem for product, service and rental marketplace verticals. VQ Marketplace Ecosystem will be the first system which allows the demand and supply to deal with each other on the platform across different marketplace verticals without any fee or commission. In addition to that, we will build marketplace templates for all the supported verticals that can be customized and deployed cost-free by anyone in our ecosystem. The decentralized system will hold the VQ listings and booking ledger. Existing platforms (e.g. Amazon.com, Airbnb.com, TaskRabbit.com) are currently centralized and take fees from the supply and/or the demand side. Additional middlemen are the payment processors. All listings and deal parameters in the VQ Marketplace Ecosystem will be decentralized on the Ethereum blockchain, eliminating all middlemen and guaranteeing transparent execution.

Value for Marketplace Creators

We enable entrepreneurs and small business owners to start their own marketplace platforms in seconds. One-click solutions for coping predefined marketplace templates and other running marketplaces will be provided. No developers are needed for starting a new marketplace. The marketplace can be easily built and managed through the Admin dashboard. Enabling anyone to start an online rental, service and product marketplace will boost competition and ensure that the marketplaces must stay on the edge to stay in business. We will build an ecosystem that is self-sufficient and powerful enough to compete with the biggest marketplace providers in the over 1 trillion online marketplace sector.

Value for Suppliers

In the VQ Marketplace Ecosystem, suppliers who post listings on one marketplace will be able to publish their listings automatically on other marketplaces in the same vertical in the ecosystem. Product marketplaces, apartment rentals, services and ride-sharing marketplaces are examples of possible verticals. Furthermore, we will implement Network Effects to connect and boost collaboration among suppliers on the platform.

Value for Customers

Customers will be able to browse for the properties, products, and services, using both web and mobile apps. Customers will be able to access the same platform across different boundaries. The zero commission will provide the lowest rates, possible only when end customer and property owner deal directly. Customers will have one global account in the ecosystem and one global reputation.

Value for the world

The entire end-user application codebase of VQM is and will be completely open-sourced to boost competition and lower market entry in the Marketplace Ecosystem.","Commerce and Shopping, Financial Services, Payments, Software",vqmarketplace.com

If wealth is defined as “the repertoire of physical transformations that one is capable of causing (David Deutsch)” then this reduction in friction should lead to a massive increase in wealth.

Large projects are usually designed and managed from the top down. Cynch helps remove the top down nature of project management.  Once a project has been orchestrated and the work to be performed has been documented, Cynch will allow the work to be dynamically executed through a set of smart contracts.  These smart contracts allow for an approach to projects that we call “Just in Time Execution.”

Blockchain technologies and the decentralization that they enable will create significant disruption across many industries in the coming years.  Fundamental to this movement is the ability to execute value transfers in a trustless environment.  Our CynchTask Contracts abstract work orchestration into a few basic api endpoints.  We pair this abstraction with a dynamic and robust orchestration platform, Cynch, that has its roots in robust project management system and is already in use by major corporations.  These orchestrations further enable capturing value in many ways including:

Reduced friction in resource verification and compensation.  
Define a blockchain of custody for work objects.
Create a shared data space that streamlines auditing and the sharing of reports.

Once an ecosystem of market participants develop around doing work on the Cynch platform we can create additional value by gamifying negotiations using a decentralized request for proposal(RFP) management platform.

The system will eventually develop a rich set of data that can packaged and sold in a data market to project managers seeking to bid and scope upcoming projects.

The Cynch system will be based upon an open source protocol that will allow third party developers to add value to the system by creating Dapps and other system integrations that are beyond the capacity and expertise of the core Cynch team.","Energy, Information Technology",cynch.co

South American countries are known for falling behind in technological advancements such as the internet and mobile. Blockchain, cryptocurrencies, and DLT technologies offer a more transparent, decentralized, and faster transaction of data and information across borders. 

South American citizens have been victims of hyperinflation, corruption, economic disasters and political instability. As with most big tech companies, not so many blockchain projects have set their eyes on the Latin American continent for varied reasons, problems, and resources. We want to change that, thus we believe with education, we will be able to create entrepreneurs, students, and professionals hungry to thrive in this disruptive wave, thus creating an ecosystem of talented individuals to compete with leading countries in the industry and resolve some of South Americans biggest flaws.
Latinos have 65% mobile penetration and 55% of its citizens are unbanked.

Together with Lumit Blockchain and Blockchain at Berkeley, we launched an online e-learning platform called Academia 21 to educate Latinos about blockchain in Spanish and offer courses for blockchain development, fundamentals, business use cases, smart contracts, token economics, investing, token creation and more.

Our vision is to be the gateway of blockchain powered solutions to South American governments and companies within the supply chain management, healthcare, and real estate industries.","Education, Information Technology, Internet Services",latamblockchain.net/

The Flying Money Tokens (FML) we issue in the ICO are the transaction tokens used to buy and sell Flying Money Currency Tokens that will be issued after the ICO. The utility of the FML Tokens is that once used to pay for transactions they are destroyed and therefore reduce the total number of FML Tokens in circulation. 

Customers have a choice of paying their transaction fees in Fiat, BTC, ETH or FML. If customers pay their transaction fees in BTC or ETH or Fiat we use these proceeds to buy back an equivalent amount of FML tokens and destroy these FML tokens. We buy these on digital exchanges that list our FML Tokens. There is a constant demand for FML Tokens and a diminishing supply.

For example if this was around during the time of Da Vinci, he could have recorded his paintings onto the blockchain and attached a QR code to the back of them. Then today we would be able to scan that QR and trace the painting back to him. This is a huge deal as some art experts claim almost 50% of paintings in museums are fake.
Another use case would be for cars. Each car could have a QR code attached and every time a mechanic does a repair they could add that service record to the car's ledger, creating permanent service records (a big issue faced with buying used cars is a lack of service records).",Information Technology,fabryc.org

Measure Protocol,"Blockchain, Computer, Market Research, Software",Measure Protocol is a  blockchain-powered marketplace for person-based data.,Feb 2018,—,Active,—,—,"Measure is a blockchain powered economy for human-generated data.

People have insufficient control over their data. It is frequently unclear when and where data about them is being captured or used and when it is, they are being compensated poorly or not at all and have to trust the companies using it to keep it private. Yet, much of the world is fuelled by person-based data — from social and marketing research to advertising, finance, and insurance — data about individuals and populations drives everything from product development to public policy.

Measure democratizes access to accurate data about individuals and populations while allowing people to maintain sovereignty over their data. Measure does this by introducing a new blockchain-based protocol that facilitates the network and infrastructure to form a marketplace. On one side of the market are individuals who contribute data by completing tasks, surveys or providing access to data sources such as health and location data. On the other side are buyers of person-based data, such as marketers, researchers and advertisers. Between them is software and a public blockchain that allows buyers to interact directly with individuals in a way that protects the privacy of the individual, incentivizes accuracy, and provides transparency around data usage and payment.

A primary goal of the protocol is to maximize the supply of accurate, representatively sampled data about individuals. It features a simple, standardized pricing model indexed by scarcity and complexity, a reputation system for both buyers and contributors that encourages efficient survey design and good faith participation, and a set of economic incentives to encourage data reuse.","Consumer Electronics, Data and Analytics, Design, Hardware, Software",www.measureprotocol.com

Bank of Hodlers,"Banking, Blockchain, Cryptocurrency, FinTech, Payments","Storage, payments and credit powered by the blockchain.","Mar 15, 2018",—,Active,—,—,"Hi there! if you’re reading this, you’re probably like us – have pretty much all your wealth stored in digitized (or soon to be digitized) assets like money in your bank, mutual funds, stocks or real estate.

You probably have a financial advisor guiding you through your investments, a manager from your bank who helps you stay on top of your mortgage payments and a government that prints money responsibly to not de-value your lifetime of savings. 

But how do you know that the bank manager or your financial advisor has your best interests at heart instead of their own fee and commissions? Your contract explicitly states that they are not responsible for your loss even as they verbally assure you otherwise. 

How do you know that the digital assets won’t be hacked (traditional bank websites get hacked all the time)? Or that your physical assets won’t be stolen(bank robberies) or taken by fraud (enough examples in real estate)?

Governments fall all the time, or change their monetary policies - and your currency today can literally have no value tomorrow (Indian demonetization, Argentina, Venezuela). How do you know it won’t happen to your country?

Do you ask these questions? Well, we do all the time. 

To answer these questions and why we created the Bank of Hodlers, we have to dive into the details of how banking evolved.

As early as the 2nd century BC, people who could save money started lending them out to people who could borrow and pay back with interest. Banking as an industry thrived in Italy and grew with the expansion of the Roman Empire. 


During the 20th century, developments in telecommunications and computing caused major changes to banks' operations and let banks dramatically increase in size and geographic spread. This consolidated the industry and gave the power to a few firms.

Fast forward to 2007: their recklessness caused the financial crisis of 2007–2008 forcing failure of many banks, including some of the world's largest banks.

The government let the banks live by infusing 1.2 trillion dollars of the taxpayer’s money into a handful of banks and in turn, created the need, wave of innovation and a community for blockchain and the concept of decentralization to thrive. 

Here’s Alan Greenspan (Chairman – Federal Reserve: 1987-2006), the guy who decided how much money to print in America, admitting that his model was flawed in 2008. Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5lZPWNFizQ

In 2009, something magical happened, Satoshi Nakamoto released his white paper which removed the need for a centralized authority to facilitate transactions in a purely peer to peer and decentralized fashion and making truly beneficial for every user holding the currency. 

Some governments, after looking at the threat that bitcoin poses, have decided to take an anti-crypto stance. This ensures the network effect doesn’t happen at a scale where it replaces their national currency. 

This is where we come in. At the Bank of Hodlers, we intend to treat your cryptocurrencies as a separate asset class and offer services to ensure technologies based on blockchain are usable as of today, negating the need for the network effects and government acceptance to come in. 

We give every HODLer the ability to completely bank on blockchain today. Every once in a while, there’s a technology jump so large that completely leapfrogs every existing solution out there. Blockchain is this technology jump and the banks know this.","Financial Services, Lending and Investments, Payments, Software",www.bankofhodlers.com/

The protocol also finds applications in micro-lending, where communities can back their most trusted entrepreneurs as they look to expand their business through commercial loans. In this scenario, backers are rewarded out of the interest paid in servicing the loan, or in the case of default find their stakes remitted to the lender as a form of recourse.

Applications for the protocol are numerous, and we have a team of world-class researchers and engineers identifying opportunities and solutions in structured finance, insurance, general lending and other areas that we will expand into as we gain traction with the protocol.","Commerce and Shopping, Financial Services, Information Technology, Lending and Investments, Software",credify.one

Why we are here ?

In the current crypto market, many crypto investors lose their money, even lose all when the tokens they invest disappear in the crypto trading exchange.
With the growing doubt about crypto market nowadays, current investors are likely to exit, meanwhile new investors do not want to venture into the crypto market.
This has spiralled the Global Crypto Market deep into a long down trend, it maybe even collapses.


How it will be solved ?

300 years ago until now, the appearance of Bonds have saved and thrived the Global Security Market.
Current Global Security Market Cap is estimated by $65 trillion Stocks plus $100 trillion Bonds. We can see the enormous scale as well as the potential of Bonds Market today.
In the near future, CryptoBonds will be the biggest scale stop-loss product to save Crypto Investors. In addition, Crypto Bonds Market also will be a reliable crypto market where investors who have lost their confidence in crypto market can put their trust in.


Coin market cap now = $267 billion

Future Global Crypto Market Cap is calculated to be the sum of CryptoBond Market Cap + Coin Market Cap
CryptoBond Issuer - Underwriter - Relayer - Investor


What is Twogap? Unique value propositions ?

TwoGap platform was formed to bring Crypto Investors the opportunity to acquire powerful and biggest-scale stop-loss product - CryptoBond.
Solution mechanism / Technology applied
TGT token - ERC20
0x protocol
Off - chain order relay
On - chain settlement
Bonds encrypted to Crypto Bonds - Trade - Distributed Register - Clearing Programmerless & most visually graphical interface
Issuer - Underwriter - Relayer - CryptoBonds Investor
Competitor / Unfair advantages
Traditional competitors: BlackRock
Crypto competitors : USDT, TrueUSD...etc, are limited in scalability due to being backed by USD. However, CryptoBonds of Twogap expands very fast and there is virtually no limit because of Bond's back.

TGT Tokens are not security tokens. They are used to unlock services and transactions on the Twogap platform, so they are utility tokens. They are not covered by the SEC. Most tokens of competitors are security tokens, so
they may face the ban by SEC.
Special marketing channels should be especially low-cost activities. Tokenized Bonds with commandless and programmerless - graphical interface.So it’s difficult for the opponents to imitate.

Crude oil, natural gas, and coal cover today the majority of our global energy needs. But the related emissions of greenhouse gases have caused the planet’s climate to change in an unnatural manner. The world is ready for change, and the political will to act on environmental issues is here.

Unfortunately, renewables are not as reliable as conventional power plants, and electricity cannot be stored in the power grid. To ensure that the transition away from fossil fuels is a practical and achievable goal, we need efficient facilities to store renewable energy.

Therefore, Green Energy Wallet (GEW) connects batteries of many electric vehicles to use this capacity as a large buffer store for renewable energy. Solar power systems and home batteries can also be integrated. We connect charging stations with the power grid to manage the electricity with flow either way between the power grid and the battery.

Bidirectional charging stations of several manufacturers can be connected to GEW. In addition, we will develop together with a partner a bi-directional charging station tailored for GEW.

GEW works together with the energy provider to buy electricity when the price is low because of overproduction and sell it high when the power grid system needs it. In addition, GEW can ensure the power supply of your home when the power network fails.

Our GEW app can communicate between the electric vehicle, home system, charging station, and power grid. Additionally, the GEW app will contain many more useful functions, such as providing easy access to the vehicle’s and home’s system settings and diagnostics.

GEW rewards clients through a GEW token reward system for providing buffer storage and data and for using our GEW network. The energy trading and the GEW token reward system will be based on blockchain technology.","Energy, Sustainability",www.greenenergywallet.com/

Vreo will supply game developers and game publishers with plugins and algorithms for numerous game engines, that greatly facilitate the dynamic placing of embedded ads on various platforms.  In contrast to traditional in-game promotion like pop-ups, embedded ads blend in with the game‘s environment without disturbing the players experience.

Vreo likewise optimizes billing and evaluation in digital advertising. Vreo’s plugins and algorithms for dynamic ad placement meticulously document not only the exact number of views but also the quality of each view. Besides significantly impeding ad-blocking and ad-fraud, evaluating the quality of views prevents counterproductive omnipresence of individual ads as well.

As an exchange for dynamic in-game advertising, Vreo is developing a b2b marketplace using its dedicated ViewCoin, a proposed stablecoin pegged with fiat currency. As opposed to the traditional ad market, Vreo’s ViewCoin based marketplace enables fast, cheap international transactions. During the ICO, Vreo will issue MeritCoin (MTC). MeritCoin holders will be given special access in to the data and services in the Vreo Platform. By purchasing the MeritCoin, buyers can link the same to ViewCoin and access various benefits such as preferential matching, privileged ad delivery, discounts, reduced fees, etc.

The social good sector is defined as encompassing development assistance, humanitarian relief, and charitable organizations. This sector is the backbone behind the 17 Sustainable Development Goals that nearly all countries in the world have agreed to achieve by 2030. The sector has a worldwide annual turnover of over US $2 trillion. The sector is massively fragmented and extremely inefficient. Despite huge compliance costs it is estimated that 30% of funds get lost due to corruption. Further 10% are paid in bank fees and lost due to exchange rate differences. At the same time, customer acquisition cost (getting individual donors onboard) is often as high as 60%. 

Only a small percentage, some have estimated it to be as little as 9% of the money given to charity, reaches the beneficiaries. There is little collaboration between organizations, leading to duplication of efforts, and lost opportunities in achieving savings through economies of scale – savings that have been estimated to be as high as 40%. Organizations are neither reaping the benefit of a network effect, nor achieving collective impact gains. This is leading to donors losing trust in the social good sector, which in turns leads to less funding.

With such a high percentage of the money raised for charitable causes being lost in corruption, operational inefficiencies, and banking fees, a solution that increases transparency and improves operational inefficiency, simply by 5-10% creates a massive opportunity for social good organizations to increase their impact with more money being made available to the beneficiaries themselves. 

Making the world a better place is a big business that is ripe for disruption, and we want to make the social good sector more efficient, impactful, and inclusive and we can do this in a sustainable manner, in a market that is largely untapped today.

We plan to do this by building a common „digital infrastructure“ for the social good sector to operate on top of. This allows us to enable achieve economies of scale, greatly reduce inefficiencies, and improve transparency across the whole sector. This infrastructure provides common services that not only improve current approaches, but also enable new and innovative approaches to dealing with social problems.","Community and Lifestyle, Financial Services",eirium.tech

The Life of Riley Club,"Asset Management, Blockchain, Collaborative Consumption, Marketplace, Mobile Apps, Sharing Economy, Social Network",The home of shared ownership,"Jan 1, 2018",—,Active,—,—,"The Life of Riley Club is an exclusive private members club and social network, with a
strict admissions policy. It provides its members with the ability to share ownership of
high-value, luxury assets with like-minded peers in a trusted exclusive environment. It’s
an innovation on the success of private members clubs like Soho House, revolutionising
how people purchase, use and sell luxury assets.

The Club connects members together into a shared group who have a common
interest in owning the same luxury asset. The shared group will then be connected
directly to the seller. This lowers the cost of the asset to the individual by a fraction
defined by the size of the shared group.

Our amazing App provides members with the marketplace of assets for sale including
marine, automotive, aviation and property. The Club then sets the asset into a safe
autonomous structure and the App manages their asset in all respects from booking
to maintenance to finance. We use technology to put people together and make
sharing an asset as accessible as sole ownership but as simple as using a rented one.

The sharing economy (the fastest-growing tech sector) is currently about short-term
rental, leveraging the connected mobile world to put the buyer and seller directly in
contact. We are about ownership. Our proposition uses the same technology but is
more long-term, allowing cheaper access more frequently. Enabling swapping within
the membership makes this a compelling proposition. I can swap a week in my Aston
Martin for a week in your Chalet. This is the next evolution in the sharing economy.

In the same way Airbnb used technology to revolutionise property rental and Uber to
disrupt the private transport world, The Life of Riley Club provides an opportunity to
disrupt luxury ownership, making it more accessible through the sharing economy.
This provides a new distribution channel for vendors to access a younger, tech-savvy
generation. At a lower price point, you access a larger audience whilst maintaining
prestige through our exclusive Club. In many ways it is more appealing than whole
ownership, whatever your status.","Apps, Commerce and Shopping, Financial Services, Internet Services, Mobile, Software",www.thelifeofriley.club/

MarbCoin is a crypto currency for a blockchain based application that will make the real estate market cheaper and more transparent. The new application can be used to directly buy or sell a home, rent a property out, get financing for a property by means of crowdfunding or even to invest in real estate projects.

At the moment, the purchase and sale of a property is not always clear. What are the total costs including taxes, surcharges and let’s not forget the costs of the real estate agents. If all this information was stored in a free and public accessible library like a blockchain the costs -and risks- involved with purchasing a home would go down.  

MarbCoin is working on such an app based on blockchain technology, including ""Smart Contracts"",   a smart contract is like a digital contract. For example a seller can list a property, and any interested party can directly place an offer. If the owner agrees (after optional negotiations) the app creates a standard contract.  And the buyer can create a crowdfunding contract to pay for the property and pay the owner in MarbCoins. If needed, these MarbCoins are easily converted in non-crypto currency.

Akbar,"Blockchain, Cryptocurrency, Religion",Akbar is a cryptocurrency for Muslims to harness their religious faith by discovering cures to mankind’s illnesses.,"Apr 1, 2018",—,Active,—,—,"Akbar is a cryptocurrency for Muslim (or Non-Muslims) to harness their religious faith for the good of mankind by using their computers for scientific progress by discovering cures to mankind’s illnesses. 

It is creative as it present a suitable alternative for Muslims to engage in cryptocurrency without violating their religious faith – the Quran mentioned that no currency can be used to speculate with, can be earned through interest, and can be inflationary. Fiat currencies and most cryptocurrencies are not shariah-compliant. Akbar, however, rewards users for helping mankind; “work units” are sent by a program to online computers, which then work on them, simulating protein folding. Misfolding proteins actually cause cancers and illnesses, which increases the need for computers to discover the solutions to misfolding. Much electricity right now is wasted in attempts to mine Bitcoin and other currencies; mining Akbar is a much better use of electricity. Akbar helps the world to fulfill Sustainable Development Goal 3: Good Health and Wellbeing; therefore, it is shariah-friendly. Also, most cryptocurrencies are not widely adopted as they have “hard appeal” (good technology and fast transaction speeds) but do not have “soft appeal” (a human-based identity or culture). We are branding our cryptocurrency with a religious identity to appeal to the religious who wants to help humanity through their faith. We plan to concoct similar cryptocurrencies for other religions in the future. 

We believe that Akbar presents a viable way for Muslims who wish to dissociate themselves from the un-Muslim acts of Islamic State and terrorists to act positively for humankind and dissolve the unfavorable reputation foisted upon them by media. Since cryptocurency has created so much buzz recently amongst youth and adults alike, we can utilize it as an avenue for making positive change everywhere, since it can be entirely online and no geographic constraints. Many religious organizations may work with us as it presents an avenue to advertise their religious credentials. Noted by Muslims is that the Quran is also very scientific in approaches to discover truths about the world; thus, Akbar is compatible with Islam. 

Benchmarks of Success: 
1.	The number of people that downloads “work units” and generate Akbars.
2.	The number of shops which accepts Akbars.
3.	The daily trading volume of Akbar on cryptocurrency exchanges.
4.	The daily transaction volume of Akbars.
5.	The daily total value of goods and services purchased with Akbars. 
6.	The cancers and illnesses solved with Akbar generators. 

Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats (SWOT):
Strengths: Appeals to human religious faith and human identity, Akbar democratizes token manufacture for the masses and lets people in rural areas earn credit for helping science, Akbar’s plans to create an international financial ecosystem will ensure true international borderless payments, improves Islam’s public image after ISIS saga.
Weaknesses: Akbar conflates religious faith with the need and want to aid scientific progress which Muslims may not take kindly to, Akbar may appeal only to Muslims and not Non-Muslims, 
Opportunities: Akbar can create a truly international and halal payment ecosystem that has no parallel in the past, market promotions and opportunities to our user base and merchants, partnerships with companies and shops.
Threats: Akbar may be blocked by Islamic governments for supplanting their authority, Akbar may fail to gain majority support of Muslims across the world.","Community and Lifestyle, Financial Services, Payments, Software",—

LUCA - Blockchain
Features of LUCA Architecture
1. Separating token transactions and computing by connecting the public chain and the private chain;
2. More added values by allowing miners to maintain ledger and realize project computing.

As ETH is a sophisticated blockchain supported by numerous miners, we choose ETH smart contract as transaction medium for AIgatha token. 
It can also avoid transaction congestion due to shortage of miners at the early phase of AIgatha.

Pangu - Distributed computing system
In this phase, we will implement DC system on the blockchain. 

Features of Pangu Architecture:
1. The cost of the computing power engaged in the jobs depends the amount of payment. Every task released in the Primordial Soup will be involved with more than two miners.
2. More than 2 miners will be assigned to one task so as to increase the return rate; their results will be verified with each other in order to ensure the accuracy of the results simply.
3. Blockchain make the status of these tasks become open and transparent. Information includes the miners responsible for computing, the computing duration and so on. By doing so, some existing problems in the DC products such as black-box operation will be addressed.
4. Task assignment mechanism is designed to make cloud computing safer by eliminating the possibility that miners cannot assemble the whole picture of one job in spite that they are computing many tasks in one job.
5. Mist computing will reduce the dependence in the cloud computing.
6. Whitelist mechanism only allows users with ID verfication to use the system so as to aviod malicious use.
7. Simple and intuitive-to-use interface and DC API allow users to quickly master the system to solve all kinds of problems.

This phase is named Pangu when we will build DC system based on LUCA.

IChing -  AI services platform 
At this phase, we will develop different types of AI services platform based on blockchain.

Features of AI Services Platform:
1. Common/Easy File Format: Users only need to save the data file as CSV. file which can be read by the AI services platform for forecasting services.
2. Intuitive-designed Graphic Operation Interface: Programming beginners can easily use AIgatha AI services platform, skipping complicated developing process and background preparation.
3. Multiple AI Agorithms: AIgatha AI servcies platfrom can operate popular AI agorithms and will conclude with the ultimate result based on the statistics of prediction results and the development of AIgatha's technologies.
4. Forecasting Models: users can download the forecasting model built by AIgatha's AI services platform in case that it can be used for the similar topic in the future.
5. Quality Data and Powerful Analysis: data mining and machine learning will help users to develop the best applications and produce the product by searching for the answers as soon as possible.
6. Privacy and Safety: Since AIgatha's AI services platform will work out the forecasting based on statistics, users are not required to provide any name or description of eigenvalues in the dataset. The Chronos Fortress provides edge cache service that means highly privacy, consistency and extenability.
7. Selection of Important Eigenvalues: AIgatha's AI services platform will select eigenvalues for users to know which eigenvalues in the dataset are the key to the prediction, making sure users get the answers together with reasons behind.
8. Detailed and Complete Forecasting Analysis Report: Users are available to purchase the whole forecasting analysis report of the datasets that includes information processed by AI technologies such as relevant background values.

Xirang - Complete Blockchain System
In this phase, we plan to build/implement forecasting platforms based on the existing architecture.
Moreover, improved developing interface will encourage more developers to use our project developing platform. Our ultimate goal in this phase is to deploy the Chronos Fortress around the world.

Cryptlatteral,"Blockchain, Cryptocurrency, FinTech, Lending",Cryptlatteral provides margin trading infrastructure to investors and crypto-exchanges via collateralized blockchain contracts,"Jun 1, 2018",—,Closed,—,—,"Cryptlatteral’s vision is to make cryptocurrency markets more liquid by providing infrastructure to investors and cryptocurrency exchanges for margin trading via collateralized lending and borrowing contracts on the blockchain.

The cryptocurrency trading industry hit an estimated market cap of $835 Billion USD in January 2018 and is expected to grow by at least 33% annually through 2023. Much of this growth will be driven by margin trading, which we estimate will eventually represent at least 75% of total trade volume on cryptocurrency exchanges.

Crypto margin trading is currently in its infancy, with only 13% of existing cryptocurrency exchanges offering leverage options to traders. Not only is this a huge opportunity in terms of market space, but the current solutions use centralized and inefficient models, meaning that there is a clear opportunity to sell our solution to exchanges already offering margin trading.

Cryptlatteral will provide a margin lending solution to directly add additional liquidity to cryptocurrency trading by leveraging blockchain technology and encouraging scalability through the use of custom state channels and a centralized lending engine.

Only a handful of actors are attempting to tackle this market: centralized cryptocurrency exchanges, and several blockchain companies in the process of building P2P margin lending solutions for decentralized trading. Cryptlatteral is the only B2B margin lending solution currently under development.

We are a team of experienced entrepreneurs and developers with backgrounds in FX, cryptocurrency exchanges, and margin trading. Collectively, we have launched 6 successful startups, developed custom margin trading solutions, and built an FX brokerage independent of MetaTrader and other existing technical solutions. We are the owners, developers, and operators of a highly rated, mobile- first cryptocurrency exchange (Hummingbird Trading) and have a network of over 70 white label exchanges to which we can immediately sell our solution.","Financial Services, Payments, Software",cryptlatteral.com

Across Canada, the process of settling an estate (from death to distribution of assets) takes on average four years. Many factors contribute to this inefficient process that has remained largely unchanged in over 20 years. A lack of digitization and software tools are available to trust companies, who are hired on behalf of a family to execute the will and estate. 

According to corporate executors, the largest inefficiencies stem from a lack of communication regarding the status of the estate, onboarding new agents, and delays with government agencies, among others.

This is compounded by creating a complex business network of banks, executors, lawyers, accountants, governments and beneficiaries coming together to settle an estate. Furthermore, there is an inherent lack of trust among each party as they can be individually held legally liable for any error committed throughout the process.

We have seen that across north America there is a growing demand for estate services while the continent prepares for the largest transfer of wealth in history. In fact, it is projected that in Canada alone, $750 billion dollars will be inherited over the next decade, [1] a majority of which will demand the services of corporate agents. As it stands, trust companies are not able to keep up with internal demand for settlement services, let alone market their services to a large growing market.

Estateably aims to solve the inefficiencies of the estate settlement process by providing a workflow tool to trust companies to digitize their process, automating time-consuming tasks. The platform will leverage distributed ledger technology to create a bridge between financial institutions and appropriate government agencies.","Information Technology, Software",www.estateably.com

Customer need:

OkayCrypt detects fraudulent virtual activities, prevent money laundering and the financing of terrorism.

OkayCrypt works non-stop and helps to monitor suspicious transactions and report risk score with illegal activities without delay.

Products and services:

OkayCrypt makes it possible to analyze Bitcoin transactions, associate the address with the wallet, identify the sources of income, including the income from illegal and criminal activities.

Worldwide.

Customers:

FinTech companies: Banks, Crypto Exchanges, Crypto Lending platforms. 
RegTech sector: Regulators, AML/CFT organizations and funds, Governance.

Our main customers are Crypto Exchanges because the cryptocurrency mainstream passes through them.

We contacted some crypto exchange platforms and they assured us they were interested in such solution. Some of them use our competitors’ products, but they’re not satisfied with quality or/and price


How does it work? 

1. OkayCrypt has analyzed the entire Bitcoin Blockchain and grouped all addresses by the user wallets, establishing all existing links on the transactions. It is a very big graph; and our system is working with it non-stop, monitoring all new blocks of the chain and analyzing them.

2. Our system parses hundreds of public resources, finds their bitcoin-addresses and assesses the public content using Machine Learning.

3.Having received a request, OkayCrypt system:
- Gets all addresses of the user’s wallet and many of the addresses that are linked to the user’s addresses
- Searches for these addresses in our databases and establishes a connection with certain activities (exchanges, mining-pools, gambling, scam, hacking, etc) 
- Analyzes the results and provides a complete report on the address/transaction:
*The date when the activity in the Bitcoin network began
*The amount of all transactions
*First/Last transaction
*Current balance on the user’s accounts
*Different types of activity (%)
*Risk assessment of dealing with this user
*A detailed chart that shows time of big transactions on a certain address in the Bitcoin network
*Visualization of communication with other addresses and areas of activity

Sales and marketing strategy:

We are planning to conduct a JTBD among our partners (Crypto Exchanges) to identify their true needs. The main marketing message will be that our customers become part of the crypto ecosystem. This will allow them to feel part of something bigger. Also, our customers can share information (suspicious transactions, addresses of fraudsters' wallets) in exchange for free checks.","Financial Services, Payments, Software",okaycrypt.com/

World's first Creative approach to blockchain.
Where's the revolution?
Long story short: we invented and developed a solution which takes data (images/graphics/text/etc) and converts it into musical composition/soundwave, building it tone-by-tone using the AI+Blockchain and natural-like inspiration and improvisation.
With this solution we proposing a new, innovative way for melodic sequence composition, sound generation and new fundamentals for computer-based improvisation (Decentralized Improvisation).
When it comes to AI/computer-generated works, resulting in computer-generated sequences powered by pre-trained neural networks or similar machine learning algorithms, it is proximate to the result of the work of a real human being. However, while generation is highly automated and algorithmised, the result usually uses previously predefined patterns to replicate style, movement, and technique.
Our essential principle is to avoid that pre-trained models. This means, that machine-learning models, pre-trained on existing music/sounds are NOT USED for any sequence generation. We utilize machine learning algorithms for the data analysis and deep learning.
We proposing natural-like inspiration, improvisation, and jamming processes on a technological level with the aid of a blockchain.
And while currently all blockchain applications for the art/music/creative industry is about rights management, storage, direct sales and money talks, Musical Blockchain truly connects art, music and creativity with blockchain directly on many levels.
Musical Blockchain have potential applications in music (as a solution, as well as a standalone live act with an upcoming performances), art, education, medicine, city development and other areas and is expected to have a profound impact on the real world in a different ways.

PowerErn was built on the principles of decentralisation, democratisation, and profits with purpose. We believe in the power of the crowd and people’s ability to unite to create lasting positive social and environmental impacts, while also earning healthy financial returns. This equity crowdfunding campaign is the embodiment of those principles. It’s an unprecedented opportunity for anyone who shares these values to join the fast-growing PowerErn movement and benefit from the success of one of the most exciting and disruptive companies on the planet.

With the downfall of Solar Prices there’s an emerging market to facilitate funding for small-to-medium commercial and industrial distributed solar projects for schools, businesses and organisations, ranging from 50 KWp to 1 MWp in electricity-generating capacity. These projects represent a promising market that is largely untapped, primarily because traditional solar financiers and foreign investors prefer to fund larger portfolios of solar projects or centralised utility-scale solar plants.

To overcome these barriers, PowerErn has created a marketplace and unified dashboard, which connects organisations interested in deploying solar power- for small-to-medium commercial and industrial distributed solar projects for schools, businesses and organisations,(solar power off-takers) with suppliers and a passionate crowd of solar advocates and supporters from around the world.","Energy, Financial Services, Lending and Investments, Natural Resources, Sustainability",www.powerern.com

Ropemaker each month selects tenths of early stage cryptocurrencies in the middle of their ICO or literally after it and register them on its platform. We’ve designed a service tool to safely manage new crypto assets by issuers or massive stakeholders. Ropemaker helps weak or poor prepared projects get another chance to keep the project by bringing investments in different perfectly matched altcoins into the project (i.e. thanks to Ropemaker many poor ICO projects can become “micro crypto hedge funds”). Another reason to sign up at Ropemaker is a utilisation of unsoldtokens instead of burning them and change them to other tokens to sell them later and earn more money to support own project. Execution is guaranteed. Big steak holders could want to give away some tokens and get other ones instead, again Ropemaker is exactly the right place for that.","Financial Services, Lending and Investments, Payments, Software",ropemaker.io

Just as Social, Cloud, and Mobile sparked the wave of innovation in the last ten years, blockchain will most likely be a key pillar of the next internet paradigm, together with other technologies.

While this journey is slowly emerging before us, we think that stimulating the Belgian entrepreneurship around blockchain-related businesses will be key to create the necessary pre-conditions for adoption and growth.

To match our vision, we created a cooperative structure (SCRL/CVBA) where the successes of the projects are shared with the contributors and where anyone can market its skills or experience to further benefit the whole group. We believe these features are key to facilitate the emergence and adoption of blockchain-related projects in Belgium.

To execute this mission, we aim at:
Connecting all relevant actors in the Belgian scene, by organizing large events, workshops, seminars or hackathons to satisfy the needs of both the general public and industry experts;
Supporting our members and partners to reach their ambition, by finding synergies and providing a place for our members and partners to share their services with each other.
We believe this approach can help in addressing the main barriers to blockchain’s wider implementation, namely:

(1) enabling collaboration and overcoming competition,
(2) shaping a positive regulatory framework,
(3) and identify business cases that justify transition costs.",Community and Lifestyle,—

The purpose for doing this is to make Bitcoin mining decentralized again. Satoshi Nakamoto’s idealistic vision of “one CPU one vote” has been superseded by a reality dominated by a very small number of entities, some of whom have engaged in abusive practices against individual miners and the Bitcoin network as a whole. Bitcoin Gold provides an opportunity for countless new people around the world to participate in the mining process with widely-available consumer hardware that is manufactured and distributed by reputable mainstream corporations. A more decentralized, democratic mining infrastructure is more resilient and more in line with Satoshi’s original vision. They want Bitcoin to be a shared and independent currency. They don’t want any fat cat to drive Their monetary architecture. That’s why Bitcoin Gold was born, in order to bring Bitcoin mining back to the “people”.   

The Bitcoin Gold organization works to support the Bitcoin Gold cryptocurrency in particular, and the cryptocurrency space in general. Current and future operations are funded by a crypto Endowment held in multi-sig time-locked wallets.  Bitcoin Gold, BTG, is a cryptocurrency that began in 2017 as a fork of the Bitcoin blockchain.  Because Bitcoin Gold began as a fork, it contains the full transaction history of the Bitcoin blockchain up until the fork date, including the exact balances of Bitcoins held in wallets around the world. Any wallet address holding a Bitcoin balance immediately before the the fork held an equivalent balance of Bitcoin Gold immediately after the fork.  The original Bitcoin blockchain and the new Bitcoin Gold blockchain both continue onward independently after the fork, unaffected and unimpeded by each other.  As a result of this process, a new cryptocurrency was born.","Community and Lifestyle, Financial Services, Lending and Investments, Natural Resources, Payments, Software",bitcoingold.org/

Our mission is to “Create an open, secure and decentralised blockchain network for autonomous vehicles where cars communicate and learn from each-other, where no car can be hacked and where privacy, safety and security of the passengers is always the priority.” 

We have purchased and assembled two semi-autonomous vehicles. We also developed the decision making software for them and connected them to a private blockchain permissioned network. The cars can be requested from a mobile app and they drive to the pickup point, wait for pickup and then to the drop off destination (in a private car park or other contained environments). 

Our focus is on building the communications layer for the self-driving vehicles of the future and making sure these communications are perfectly encrypted and no car can be hijacked by hackers. Secure data exchange with these vehicles is our top concern and mission. We have committed important resources by going to the basics on how a self-driving car is built, how its software is written and how it works and understanding how to connect it to a secure network powered by a distributed ledger technology (blockchain). 

We have done a few demos and countless proofs of concepts and are now ready to present our progress with car manufacturers around the world, seeking partnerships and development for various test cases. 

We are an experienced team which has been working in the transportation software space for over 7 years and have built multiple mobility and dispatching solutions.

Investing in ICOs is a potentially hyper-profitable, yet high-risk industry. The market for ICOs is currently at the development stage and is not yet fully regulated, and there is no reliable set of criteria for the evaluation of projects; all of which creates potential pitfalls for investors.

At ICORating they aim to develop clear assessment standards for projects and assign ratings based on a transparent and standardized scale. A profound and unbiased analysis of a project (the technical features of its platform, the business model, the team, strengths and weaknesses of the decentralized infrastructure, etc) allows us to objectively evaluate risks and create a complete picture of the project and its potential.

A rating conducted by ICORating provides investors with a foundation for making a well-informed and reasoned decision. At the same time it demonstrates the openness and commitment of the project founders, thus making it more investor-attractive, and raising a project's chances of conducting a successful ICO.

Their main mission is to help the market achieve the necessary standards of quality, transparency and reliability.","Financial Services, Payments, Software",icorating.com

The user’s fingerprint is captured with highly sophisticated encryption and uses this algorithm as the password, phrase, pin and seed. One of the most compelling features of the fingerprint wallet is not just the ability to identify the owner’s fingerprint, but also determine if the input is from that live person. The fingerprint reader in their fingerprint wallet is so technologically advanced that it can actually read the pulse and blood flow of a fingerprint to verify that the authentication is from a live person, and not just an image of their fingerprint.

They feel capacitive biometrics will be the future method of authorization for many applications ranging from credit card payments to rental cars and medical records.

ITBiometrics™ will be at the forefront of all efforts to improve security, reduce risk, and deliver a seamless and convenient user experience in all areas where identification is critical.

Seamless online and in-person product discovery and payments
 

ATHASHTAGS is the first and only marketplace to personalise online and in-store product recommendations from the smallest to largest brands locally and globally.
It uses advanced AI to combine technologies that help consumers with adaptive online and in-store personalized product recommendations, payments and deeper engagement with brands.
By doing this, shopping becomes much more accessible and convenient for the shopper.
“An open and transparent shopping universe is good for customers”
Marc Lore - Walmart CEO
Shopper behaviour is ever changing, to fully understand it, one must be able to get the complete overview of their shopping actions to better understand them and make suitable recommendations to meet their needs. The best way to get this overview is to understand their shopping habits online, offline, with small brands and large brands, locally and if possible globally.
It has so far been impossible to combine products from small and big brands available online and in-store into one marketplace. By combining small and big brands, all retail can potentially be catalogued so that everything a shopper needs to buy online and in-store can be found and purchased in one place.
This biggest problem with combining small and large retailers’ online and in-store product information is consumer expectation from both are very distinct, to be able to combine both would mean, all these expectations must be exceeded.
“AtHashtags has figured a way to combine all retail into one marketplace using advanced AI.”
Consumers seamlessly discover and make payment for products from smallest to largest brands online and in-person using artificial intelligence (AI), augmented and virtual reality (AR/VR), connected online and in-person marketplaces (connected malls, pop up shops, retail stores) supported by an innovative proprietary payment system (Point of sale – POS).
“The vision is to bridge the massive gap between online and offline shopping between consumer, small and large brands regarding discovery, purchase especially payments for small brands, spaces and fulfilment to create an open world of seamless shopping.”
 
Using a unique AI algorithm called ASH to solve the problem 80% of shoppers have which is wasting a lot of time searching by combining items from small and big brands (the way they shop in the real world), helping them find these items online, leading them to physical stores near them to buy, click and collect.
For small brands, it solves the problem of consumer confidence and trust with enhanced seamless discovery and deeper engagement online and in-store. It does this by allowing them to appear in multiple connected physical stores and marketplaces to bring them in closer proximity to shoppers and help them scale faster. 
The proprietary payment system supports seamless payments for ATHASHTAGS consumers online and in-stores. This makes it possible for brands to only need one inventory and point of sale system for their global sales.
Big brands benefit from adding more online and footfall sales, smaller brands products get cross promoted and is proven to increase sales.
ATHASHTAGS app is a smart AI powered augmented reality (AR)shopping browser with image, product and facial recognition scanners combined with 3D visualisations.
The proprietary AI algorithm called ASH (Augmented Search Hashtags) personalises users’ shop pages to items they will most likely buy and content most suited to them. This AI measures proximity, previous purchases, views what their followers and following have bought, increasing consumer confidence, spend, minimising returns and need to refund.
A strong leader in the AI and Payments space. We envision a world where a shopper has no boundaries locally and globally on what they can acquire and the immediacy of receiving their orders.

Hi, we are CoolDex and we want you to thrive! CoolDex has built a world-class Hybrid DEX, powering the future of Digital Finance.
In our view, there are fundamentally two different types of Crypto related exchanges: the centralized ones that hold your funds and just focus on crypto 2 crypto types of trading; and the ones that let you be in control of your funds, offer a decentralized P2P trading model, not only trade crypto but create a whole ECO-system around the exchange which makes it easy and simple to use. This last type of exchange is what CoolDex will offer. Even though we are a small own funded Digital Exchange, we strongly believe that with our exchange which will grow bigger, stronger and be more used than any other exchange in the near future. We will play an ever more important role in world finance, tokenizing financial assets and offer multiple pairs of fiat, crypto and digital assets.

-

CoolDex solving problems

Many of the current crypto exchanges suffer from a number of problems:

● Technical architecture
Many exchanges are put together quickly in a modular model, by good tech people, but who have little or no experience in finance or in operating an exchange. They often choose the simplest approach to get the system up and running. While this may work well in the beginning, as traffic grows, the system will not able to handle the increased load. Exchanges need to be engineered from the ground up with security, efficiency, speed, and scalability in mind. This often slows down the initial development, but is critical for long-term success.

Our team has decades of combined experience building and maintaining a world class financial system that shape the economy.

● ​Security
There are hundreds of centralised exchanges that went down due to being hacked. That is why a hybrid DEX has the future. We offer the user to control their own funds and trade directly P2P with other users. KYC/AML is required in our ECO-system. We operate under an European, Estonian license.

CoolDex is built to high standards, audited and penetration tested. We have experience building financial systems to the highest security standards and strive to ensure security first. Our system uses the best security tools available on the market.

● ​Market liquidity
Professional traders and normal users are significantly affected by this. Having a low volume orderbook means less users interested to use an exchange, which makes it not attractive for traders. Attracting new users, institutional investors and large traders for new exchanges is essential and always seems a difficult task. Luckily the founders of CoolDex have extremely strong experience in online marketing.

CoolDex’s team has many years of experience in the Crypto industry. The team has worked on and operated a number of exchanges, and have accumulated a large network of partners in this space. These partners will contribute to the overall success of CoolDex.

● ​ Poor customer service
Traders are a different type when it comes to users. Understanding the trader mentality is vital for running a successful exchange. Money is literally on-the-line. Many exchanges service traders as if they were running a social media site. A 3-second delay in seeing your friends’ status update would hardly be noticed, but on an exchange, the same would be unacceptable, resulting in a mountain of user complaints. In additional to the technology stack, CoolDex is built with service in mind. CoolDex shares support responsibilities across the entire staff and company. When a trader has a problem, they get an answer directly from someone who knows the system and not someone reading from a script. 24 hours, 7 days per week in Portuguese, English and Dutch. In a later stage we will add more native speaking support employees for other languages.

Can we solve our problems?

 Short answer: No, we cannot. 
 Long answer: Yes, we certainly can.

 So many different things affect our lives,  almost everyone has 'something' to do or finish...it appears as a neverending cycle of turmoil.

Is it a real cycle of turmoil? Or perhaps is it only relative to the onlooker?

Is the chaos only relative to the organism looking in, or is chaos apparent in the entirety of the system? 

 This chaos is part of a system; like a hardcoded program. It's apparent, systems live within systems, distributing information at fantastic speed. A complex network between these systems causes a dynamic equilibrium, maintained in perpetuity until it is interrupted by a bad actor. Bad actors disperse irrelevant and provocative information throughout the network, causing chaos. Once achieved harmony from the dynamic equilibrium is shattered, causing ripples throughout varying components of the system. Degradation occurs in the network in sections where the bad actor's information stockpiles. Reattaining dynamic equilibrium is a necessity before the system will function properly again: as a whole. 

 A tree can grow after it breaks limbs, although it's doomed, altered in our perception, forever. Until the beauty of the tree is re-balanced, by an outside force.

 Anything can be proven possible in time. Even the most corrupted and degraded systems continue to function after maintenance.

Our mission is to fix the distribution of information on a global scale. The delivery of vital information keeps the system alive. Delivering education in a properly structured format is the first step to improving the globe. We propose a solution, with the integration of a combinatory of technologies.

Simulated/Augmented Reality
Digital Textbook/Interactive Compendium

 By selectively designing the following technologies, an official global curriculum can exist, that adheres to strict standards and protocols, one that does not interrupt developing narratives and creative flows.
