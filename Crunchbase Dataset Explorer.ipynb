Yet taking new products and solutions to market remains massively complicated, highly manual, and risk-prone. There has been no simple, efficient and integrated way for resellers to market and sell their solutions.  Until now.\\n\\nAt InXero, our mission is to simplify the entire go-to-market process so that resellers can move fast and sell solutions effortlessly - all with the latest industry intelligence, vendor content and digital reach.  That’s why we have delivered the InXero platform - the industry’s first Sales Enablement and Go-to-Market platform for marketing and selling of single- and multi-vendor solutions for unique buyer needs.  With InXero, your team will have all the benefits of close collaboration with your buyer, vendor and distributor partners while gaining the speed and agility needed to win in this fast-paced, dynamic world.   \n",

Using the latest technology at every step, we locate recipients, integrate them into electronic payments networks, and monitor transfers end-to-end. We charge the full cost of delivering this service and nothing more.\\n\\n GiveDirectly holds the top overall rating for non-profit effectiveness by GiveWell and received the inaugural Google Global Impact Award. Our unorthodox approach – allowing the poor, and not the donor, to choose where they invest – has prompted extensive media debate with headlines ranging from “The Best and Simplest Way to Fight Global Poverty” (Slate) to “Can Four Economists Build the Most Economically Efficient Charity Ever?” (Atlantic) and “Is it Nuts to Give to the Poor Without Strings Attached?” (New York Times Magazine).\\n\\n We are looking for exceptional talent to help us build the world's most efficient, transparent and scalable system to transfer resources directly into the hands of the poor -- and in the process transform the way international development is done.   \n",
